# Venue-Search-Project1
Application that allows users to look up venues or genres of music in the state of Colorado.

User Story:
~As a user, when I look at the beginning page, I am presented with the title and search venue/genre bar underneath when I look underneath the Search Bar,

~I am presented with a card of events happening near the userâ€™s location and a previous searches container along with a popular search container

~As a user when I am typing a venue out on the search bar, I am presented with an autocomplete/dropdown menu of the venue the user is searching for

~when I click or submit a venue name; the events happening near you is replaced with events for the venue and/or events of specific genre events, with a list of events underneath

~when I click on an event of choice I am taken to a new HTML that shows event details

Motivation: The motivation for this application is to help tourists and locals easily find upcoming music events in the state of Colorado by searching by venue or by genre.
